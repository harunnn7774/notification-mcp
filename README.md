## Features

- **AI Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with AI agents to enhance task management.
- **Sound Notifications**: Play custom sounds when tasks are completed.
- **TypeScript Support**: Built using TypeScript for type safety and better development experience.
- **Node.js Compatibility**: Runs on Node.js, ensuring a robust and scalable server.
- **MCP Compliance**: Follows the Model Context Protocol standards for consistency and reliability.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Notification MCP server, follow the steps below. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- TypeScript (installed globally)

You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harunnn7774/notification-mcp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd notification-mcp
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. **Start the Server**:

   Run the following command to start the MCP server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Configure Your AI Agent**:

   Your AI agent should connect to the MCP server and listen for task completion events. When an event occurs, the server will trigger the corresponding notification sound.

3. **Playing Sounds**:

   You can customize the sounds that play by modifying the configuration files in the `config` directory. Ensure that the sound files are accessible to the server.

### Example Configuration

Hereâ€™s an example configuration file for your AI agent:

```json
{
  "agentName": "TaskNotifier",
  "serverUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
  "notificationSound": "path/to/sound/file.mp3"
}
```

### Sample Agent Code

Below is a simple example of how your AI agent might look:

```typescript
import { MCPClient } from 'mcp-client';

const client = new MCPClient('http://localhost:3000');

client.on('taskCompleted', (task) => {
  console.log(`Task ${task.id} completed!`);
  client.playSound(task.notificationSound);
});
```
